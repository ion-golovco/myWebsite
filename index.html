        <p class="text"> Here you can find lots of articles,stories,
            and other updates from my daily life. This
            website is mainly just a test
            and a way to learn faster coding in CSS,Javascript and HTML .
            I'll try to update this website as much as i
            can because it's actually pretty fun. You can also find
            here my stream schedule or at least you can find when my next stream will be.

                Now that i think of it the title sounds kind of weird desn't it?
                It's more of a foundation than a skeleton tho.

            <p class="text">
                This thing is cool rigth? Its like global market stocks or whatever.
                It's really simple and you can just add to other stuff if you want to.
                After all the source code is open source.

            <p class="text">
                This is probably my longest code yet. I'ts pretty complicated and not really
                that effecient but it works fine.It generates random numbers and then tells you
                how many of each there are.

            <p class="text">
                This "little" program takes seconds as input and gives you an translation in other measuring units.
                I think its pretty cool.

            <h1 class="title"> More angleatrons because why not. </h1>
            <p class="text">
                I'ts pretty similar to the last one but now it has different colors
                and changes angle every frame . It takes a lot of time but you can actulay see the evolution
                of the so called "plant" at different angles.

            <p class="text">
                Alrigth then here you go, angleatrons are back on the menu. This code is simple
                and all but it works wonders. One really smart thing about it is that the color red
                from the RGB spectrum is changing as the leaf grows smaller.

            <p class="text">
                I made this little graph calculator thing .
                It works by firstly calculating f(x) = y from the formula
                x^a + x*b + c .Pretty simple but it had a lot of bugs at first .
                I ressolved them now and it seems to be working fine

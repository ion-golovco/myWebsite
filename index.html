            This list is purely my opinion of what I think are the best animes I watched. I am a pretty entusiastic
            anime watcher as you
            can see <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/xdboimaster">here</a>. This was a really hard list
            to create beacause its hard to pick only 5 . Here we go:<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class='title' style="font-size:20px;">Number #5 : Shokugeki no Soma
            <h2><br>
                <p class="smallText" style="font-size:15px;">The Moon Festival is Tootsuki Academy's annual gourmet
                    gala, where students comp ete against each other
                    to earn the most profit through selling their cuisine of choice. But for Souma Yukihira, it is also
                    his first opportunity to challenge the Elite Ten, the supreme council that rules over the academy.
                    However, this is only the beginning of Souma's war against the Elite Ten; a nefarious plot is
                    underway
                    that will provide Souma with the challenge he desires but will also shake the very foundations of
                    Tootsuki Academy itself.

                        <p class="smallText" style="font-size:15px;">Ryuuji Takasu is a gentle high school student with
                            a love for housework; but in contrast to his
                            kind nature, he has an intimidating face that often gets him labeled as a delinquent. On
                            the other hand is Taiga Aisaka, a small, doll-like student, who is anything but a cute and
                            fragile girl. Equipped with a wooden katana and feisty personality, Taiga is known
                            throughout
                            the school as the "Palmtop Tiger".

                                    misfit residents turn his life upside down. The decidedly average Sorata finds it
                                    difficult to fit in with the bizarre collection of dorm residents like Misaki, an
                                    energetic animator; Jin, a playwright playboy; Ryuunosuke, a reclusive programmer;
                                    and Chihiro, the dorm manager, art teacher, and party girl.

                                            Arima. But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls into
                                            a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.

        <p class="text"> Here you can find lots of articles,stories,
            and other updates from my daily life. This
            website is mainly just a test
            and a way to learn faster coding in CSS,Javascript and HTML .
            I'll try to update this website as much as i
            can because it's actually pretty fun. You can also find
            here my stream schedule or at least you can find when my next stream will be.

                This "little" program takes seconds as input and gives you an translation in other measuring units.
                I think its pretty cool.

            <h1 class="title"> More angleatrons because why not. </h1>
            <p class="text">
                I'ts pretty similar to the last one but now it has different colors
                and changes angle every frame . It takes a lot of time but you can actulay see the evolution
                of the so called "plant" at different angles.

            <p class="text">
                Alrigth then here you go, angleatrons are back on the menu. This code is simple
                and all but it works wonders. One really smart thing about it is that the color red
                from the RGB spectrum is changing as the leaf grows smaller.

            <p class="text">
                I made this little graph calculator thing .
                It works by firstly calculating f(x) = y from the formula
                x^a + x*b + c .Pretty simple but it had a lot of bugs at first .
                I ressolved them now and it seems to be working fine

            <p class="text">
                So this litle code i made works and is super cool like it changes colors and everything
                but not fast just like I like it.The colors are so nice and i love them a lot. This is a JavaScript code
                and this is my first time implementing code in an actual website and I think it turned out great!

                So I started a new project. A game!! After a long week of
                finding the best engine to make it in I
                decided to use <b>Godot</b> a free <b>Open Source</b> Game engine.
                Its the best experience i've had so far.

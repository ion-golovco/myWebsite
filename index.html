        <p class="text"> Here you can find lots of articles,stories,
            and other updates from my daily life. This
            website is mainly just a test
            and a way to learn faster coding in CSS,Javascript and HTML .
            I'll try to update this website as much as i
            can because it's actually pretty fun. You can also find
            here my stream schedule or at least you can find when my next stream will be.

                So I started a new project. A game!! After a long week of
                finding the best engine to make it in I
                decided to use <b>Godot</b> a free <b>Open Source</b> Game engine.
                Its the best experience i've had so far.

            anime watcher as you
            can see <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/xdboimaster">here</a>. This was a really hard list
            to create beacause its hard to pick only 5. Here we go

            Alrigth then here you go, angleatrons are back on the menu. This code is simple
            and all but it works wonders. One really smart thing about it is that the color red
            from the RGB spectrum is changing as the leaf grows smaller. The leaf when the angle is
            calculated in the angleatron function also gets a number from 1 to 0 to tell the leaf how
            big it is going to be . Lets say we get 0.93 how does that affect red you ask?
            Simple , we get the value for red (which is alredy fixed at 100) and we multiply it by .93 so the
            red becomes less and less an we see more green. This gives a really nice effect as the bigger leafs
            look more old.

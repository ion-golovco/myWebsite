        <p class="text"> Here you can find lots of articles,stories,
            and other updates from my daily life. This
            website is mainly just a test
            and a way to learn faster coding in CSS,Javascript and HTML .
            I'll try to update this website as much as i
            can because it's actually pretty fun. You can also find
            here my stream schedule or at least you can find when my next stream will be.

        <h1 class="title"> DevLog : Week #1 </h1>
        <p class="text">
            So I started a new project. A game!!After a long week of finding the best engine to make it in I
            decided to use <b>Godot</b> a free <b>Open Source</b> Game engine. Its the best experience i've had so far
            . Unlike a game engine i've used before this one has adjustable themes and comes with the dark theme which
            was surprising
            . It's really easy to use and really intuitive.The code is kind of weird but you get used to it really fast.
            In my opinion this game engine is a Godsent. Really hard to belive that it is free and Open source.
            Enough with that.Let's talk about the game itsel. I alredy have a pretty interesting story for it.
            I want it to be an 2D platformer game because I like them.That's it for this week's DevLog.

            Godot provides a huge set of common tools, so you can just
            focus on making your game without reinventing the wheel
            Godot is completely free and open-source under the very
            permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties,
            nothing. Your game is yours,
            down to the last line of engine code.
            After a bit more than one year of work, the Godot developers and contributors are
            delighted to get their new release out the door, Godot 3.1!
            It brings much-requested improvements to usability and many important features.
            Godot 3.1 is more mature and easy to use, and it does away with many hurdles
            introduced in the previous versions.

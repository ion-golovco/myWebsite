        <p class="text"> Here you can find lots of articles,stories,
            and other updates from my daily life. This
            website is mainly just a test
            and a way to learn faster coding in CSS,Javascript and HTML .
            I'll try to update this website as much as i
            can because it's actually pretty fun. You can also find
            here my stream schedule or at least you can find when my next stream will be.

         <h1 class="title"> DevLog : Week #2 </h1>
        <p class="text">
        Well,well,well if it hasn't been alredy 2 weeks since my last devLog. 
        Now lets be serious this is pretty hard , you know , I also have school and other 
        stuff to do so making a game is not easy. Excuses aside I think i should update you on my 
        progress with the game. In "Last's week" devLog I talked about the game engine I'm going to use 
        , Godot. After a lot of thinking I decided that I will start working on something different because
        I don't wthink that trying to program a game alone is productive so that's why I'm probably
        going to look for somebody to help me in the future regarding this matter. I'ts not like I'm giving up 
        on making a game , is just that I need a break from this concept and I should just go on to another 
        idea and come back here when I'm more prepared for it.
        </p>
         <h1 class="title"> What am I working on ? </h1>
        <p class="text">
            <b>Short answer : Everything , literally .</b>
            <br>School can get pretty tense. I have to keep up with the good grades and also a lot of projects and
            after class activities like helping younger pupils learn programing or helping other teachers with stuff. 
            Also there are a lot of test's at which I need to get good grades so my parents are happy.
            <br>
            <b>I'm thinking of a concept for a SinglePlayer Strategy game or something but that is just an idea at this point.</b>

        <p class="text"> Here you can find lots of articles,stories,
            and other updates from my daily life. This
            website is mainly just a test
            and a way to learn faster coding in CSS,Javascript and HTML .
            I'll try to update this website as much as i
            can because it's actually pretty fun. You can also find
            here my stream schedule or at least you can find when my next stream will be.

            This list is purely my opinion of what I think are the best animes I watched. I am a pretty entusiastic
            anime watcher as you
            can see <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/xdboimaster">here</a>. This was a really hard list
            to create beacause its hard to pick only 5 . Here we go:<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class='title'>Number #5 : Shokugeki no Soma</h2>
        <p class="text">The Moon Festival is Tootsuki Academy's annual gourmet
            gala, where students comp ete against each other
            to earn the most profit through selling their cuisine of choice. But for Souma Yukihira, it is also
            his first opportunity to challenge the Elite Ten, the supreme council that rules over the academy.
            However, this is only the beginning of Souma's war against the Elite Ten; a nefarious plot is
            underway
            that will provide Souma with the challenge he desires but will also shake the very foundations of
            Tootsuki Academy itself.

        <h2 class='title'>Number #4 : Toradora
        </h2>
        <p class="text">Ryuuji Takasu is a gentle high school student with
            a love for housework; but in contrast to his
            kind nature, he has an intimidating face that often gets him labeled as a delinquent. On
            the other hand is Taiga Aisaka, a small, doll-like student, who is anything but a cute and
            fragile girl. Equipped with a wooden katana and feisty personality, Taiga is known
            throughout
            the school as the "Palmtop Tiger".
        </p>
        <h2 class='title'>Number #3 : Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo
        </h2>
        <p class="text">When abandoned kittens and his good
            conscience force second year Sorata Kanda to move
            into Suimei High School’s infamous Sakura Hall, the satellite dorm and its
            eccentric,
            misfit residents turn his life upside down. The decidedly average Sorata finds it
            difficult to fit in with the bizarre collection of dorm residents like Misaki, an
            energetic animator; Jin, a playwright playboy; Ryuunosuke, a reclusive programmer;
            and Chihiro, the dorm manager, art teacher, and party girl.

        <h2 class='title'">Number #2 : Your Lie in April
                                                </h2>
                                                        <p class=" text">Music accompanies the path of the
            human metronome, the prodigious pianist Kousei
            Arima. But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls into
            a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.
            </p>
            <h2 class='title'>Number #1 : Clannad:After Story
            </h2>
            <p class="text">Clannad: After Story, the
                sequel to the critically acclaimed slice-of-life
                series Clannad, begins after Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa
                graduate
                from high school. Together, they experience the emotional
                rollercoaster
                of growing up. Unable to decide on a course for his future, Tomoya
                learns the value of a strong work ethic and discovers the strength
                of Nagisa's support. Through the couple's dedication and unity of
                purpose, they push forward to confront their personal problems,
                deepen
                their old relationships, and create new bonds.

        <h1 class="title">Here You Go . A website made for no reason</h1>
        <p class="text"> Here you can find lots of articles,stories,
            and other updates from my daily life. This
            website is mainly just a test
            and a way to learn faster coding in CSS,Javascript and HTML .
            I'll try to update this website as much as i
            can because it's actually pretty fun. You can also find
            here my stream schedule or at least you can find when my next stream will be.

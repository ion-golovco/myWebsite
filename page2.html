            I Started Reading Berserk not long ago and I really like it.It's pretty gore but I dont mind. Here is the
            synopsis Guts,
            a former mercenary now known as the "Black Swordsman," is out for revenge. After a tumultuous childhood, he
            finally
            finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person
            takes
            away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts
            becomes
            condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings.
